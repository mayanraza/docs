# Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Botifire! This guide takes you from a new account to a fully functional, AI-powered communication ecosystem in 4 simple steps.

## Step 1: Create Your Project

The first step is to define your project. This is the "brain" of your bot.
1. Click **Create New Project**.
2. Enter your company name, website, and industry.
3. Define your **Brand Voice**. Do you want to be formal, supportive, or energetic?
4. Save your project settings.

## Step 2: Training the AI

An AI without data is just a shell. You need to provide the knowledge it will use to help customers.
1. Use the [AI Crawler](/panel/training) to automatically suck in data from your website.
2. Upload your PDF manuals or policy documents.
3. Review the extracted links and content to ensure accuracy.
4. Click **Train AI** to finalize the Knowledge Base.

## Step 3: Configure Your Chatbot

Now that the brain is ready, choose how it interacts with the world.
- **Textual Bot**: Create a [Textual Chatbot](/panel/textual-chatbot-guide) for your website.
- **WhatsApp**: Connect your WABA and create a [WhatsApp Chatbot](/panel/whatsapp-chatbot-guide).
- **Voice AI**: Provision a phone number and set up a [Voice AI Agent](/features/voice-ai).

## Step 4: Installation & Deployment

Deploy your bot to start interacting with real users.
1. Go to **Integrations**.
2. Select your platform (e.g., [WordPress](/integrations/wordpress), [Shopify](/integrations/shopify), or JS Snippet).
3. Follow the installation steps.
4. Verify your installation to go live!

## What's Next?

Once your bot is live, don't just leave it running:
- **Monitor Behavior**: Check [Visitors & Live Chat](/panel/visitors) to see real conversations.
- **Analyze Data**: Use the [Analytics Console](/panel/analytics) to find areas for improvement.
- **Iterate**: Update your [Training Data](/panel/training) based on user feedback.

> [!TIP]
> **Start Small**: Begin with a few pages of data and expand as you learn what your customers are asking.
