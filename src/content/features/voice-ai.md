# Voice AI

Botifire's Voice AI introduces a new era of customer interaction through intelligent, human-like voice agents. Powered by advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and real-time telephony, our voice assistants handle complex inbound inquiries and execute large-scale outbound campaigns with remarkable speed and precision.

## Advanced Capabilities

Explore how our Voice AI transforms business communication:

- **Natural Conversations**: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o) to understand context, intent, and emotion.
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Optimized audio streaming ensures responses are delivered in milliseconds, maintaining a natural flow.
- **Multilingual Mastery**: Support for 30+ languages and regional accents, allowing you to scale globally.
- **Dynamic Personalities**: Customize the tone, speed, and gender of your voice agent to match your brand identity.
- **Smart Interruption Handling**: Intelligent sensitivity settings allow the bot to stop speaking when a user interrupts, just like a human.

## Technical Architecture

Our system integrates top-tier cloud technologies for a robust experience:

1. **Telephony Infrastructure**: Connected via global SIP trunking for crystal-clear audio and reliable connectivity.
2. **Speech-to-Text (Transcription)**: Real-time audio processing converts user speech into text streams.
3. **AI Reasoning Brain**: The core intelligence that processes queries against your specific Knowledge Base.
4. **Text-to-Speech (Synthesis)**: High-fidelity neural voices generate human-quality audio responses.

## Getting Started

Deploying your first voice agent is a simple three-step process:

### 1. Provision a Number
Navigate to the **Telephony** tab and acquire a dedicated local or toll-free number for your campaign.

### 2. Configure Voice Settings
In the **Bot Studio**, select your preferred language and voice profile. You can fine-tune the `speaking_rate` and `pitch` for the perfect delivery.

### 3. Assign and Test
Connect your phone number to a specific bot flow and place a test call. Your agent will be ready to assist immediately.

> [!TIP]
> **Optimizing Voice Flow**: For the best user experience, keep initial greetings concise. A quick "Hello, thank you for calling TechBackers. How can I help you today?" ensures the conversation starts without delay.

## Business Value

- **24/7 Availability**: Handle customer support any time of the day without human intervention.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Automate repetitive inquiries and focus your human team on complex problem-solving.
- **Scalability**: Manage thousands of concurrent calls simultaneously during peak hours.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Every call is recorded and transcribed, providing valuable data for quality assurance and training.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your **System Prompt** specifies that the AI is a phone assistant. Instructions like "Speak in short, clear sentences and avoid using markdown symbols" will significantly improve the audio output quality.
