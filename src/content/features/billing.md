## Management Features

Maintain full control over your billing profile from within the portal:

### 1. Flexible Plan Management
Upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time based on your current needs. Our system automatically handles proration, ensuring you only pay for what you use.

### 2. Payment Method Management
Easily add, update, or remove payment methods. Set a primary payment source to enjoy a "hands-off" billing experience.

### 3. Detailed Financial History
Access a complete archive of your past payments. From the **Invoice History** section, you can view transaction dates, amounts, and statuses, and download full PDF receipts for accounting purposes.

### 4. Real-Time Status Monitoring
Always know your current subscription state—whether your trial is active, payment is pending, or your plan is in good standing—right from the billing overview.

> [!TIP]
> **Proration Simplified**: If you upgrade mid-cycle, you are only charged the difference between the plans for the remaining time in that month. The full new rate will apply starting from your next billing date.
