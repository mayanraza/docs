# WhatsApp Flows

WhatsApp Flows enable businesses to build highly structured, interactive, and media-rich experiences directly within the WhatsApp interface. By moving beyond simple text messages, Flows allow you to collect information, guide users through complex processes, and increase engagement through intuitive UI components.

## Core Interactive Components

Our Flow Builder allows you to assemble sophisticated user journeys using a variety of interactive nodes:

- **Action Buttons**: Quick-response buttons to trigger the next step in a flow or external actions.
- **Selection Lists**: Organized menus for product categories, service options, or department routing.
- **Interactive Forms**: Collect user data like names, emails, and preferences through structured input fields.
- **Media Support**: Enrich your flow with high-quality images, PDFs, and location pins to provide a complete context.
- **Calculated Logic**: Use conditional routing to send users down different paths based on their previous answers.

## Strategic Benefits

Transform how you engage with customers on the world's most popular messaging app:

- **Frictionless Experience**: Users complete tasks without ever leaving the chat environment, leading to higher completion rates.
- **Structured Data Collection**: Ensure you receive information in the exact format you need for your CRM or backend systems.
- **Improved Lead Qualification**: Automatically filter and route leads based on their interactions within the flow.
- **Brand Consistency**: Maintain a professional and branded experience through templated yet customizable message structures.

## Real-Time Insights & Analytics

The **Flow Analytics Dashboard** provides a granular view of your performance:

- **Engagement Funnel**: Visualize how many users start, progress through, and complete your flow.
- **Node-Level Performance**: Identify high-performing steps and pinpoint where users might be dropping off.
- **Delivery Status**: Track real-time metrics for Sent, Delivered, and Read statuses to ensure your messages are reaching their target.
