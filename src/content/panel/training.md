# AI Training & Knowledge Base

Botifire's intelligence is powered by your business data. This guide explains how to effectively train your AI to provide accurate, brand-aligned responses.

## Training Sources

You can feed the AI information from three primary sources:

### 1. Document Upload (PDF/Text)
Upload your existing documentation, brochures, or manuals.
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, TXT, MD.
- **Best Practice**: Ensure documents are well-structured with clear headings and concise paragraphs.

### 2. Website Crawler
Automatically extract information from your existing website pages.
- **How it works**: Enter your URL, and Botifire will analyze all internal links.
- **Granular Control**: You can toggle individual pages on or off to decide exactly which content should be used for training.
- **Content Preview**: Preview the extracted text before finalizing the training to ensure data quality.

### 3. Manual Text Entry
Directly input FAQs, company policies, or specific instructions into the Knowledge Base.

## Intelligence Management

### Knowledge Base (KB) Versions
Every training session creates a new version of the Knowledge Base. This allows you to:
- **Track Changes**: See when the KB was last updated.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a history of what the bot knew at different points in time.

### Training Levels
You can adjust the **AI Training Level** to control how conservatively or creatively the bot uses the knowledge:
- **Strict**: The bot only answers based on provided data and avoids hallucination.
- **Creative**: The bot can rephrase and combine information for more natural conversation.

## Best Practices for Training

> [!TIP]
> **Use Quality Data**: The AI is only as good as the information it is given. Avoid conflicting data across different files.

1. **Keep it Updated**: Regularly sync your website content using the Crawler.
2. **Standardize FAQs**: Present information in Q&A format for the highest accuracy.
3. **Monitor Hallucinations**: If the bot provides incorrect info, check the Knowledge Base for ambiguity.
