## How It Works

### Crawling Process

1. **URL Submission**
   - You provide your website URL
   - System validates the URL is accessible

2. **Page Discovery**
   - If "Scan a full page" is enabled, the crawler finds all linked pages
   - System identifies different content categories

3. **Content Extraction**
   - Text content is extracted from each page
   - Information is categorized automatically
   - Content is processed and indexed

4. **Category Selection**
   - You choose which categories are relevant
   - Only selected categories will be used for training
   - This helps focus the chatbot's knowledge

## WhatsApp-Specific Considerations

### Why Website Content for WhatsApp?

Even though your chatbot will operate on WhatsApp, it still needs knowledge about your business:

- **Instant Responses:** Users expect quick answers on WhatsApp
- **24/7 Availability:** Your website content enables round-the-clock support
- **Consistent Information:** Same knowledge base as your website ensures consistency
- **Rich Knowledge:** Website content provides comprehensive information for detailed answers

### WhatsApp User Behavior

WhatsApp users typically:
- Ask direct, specific questions
- Expect quick, concise answers
- May be on mobile devices
- Prefer conversational responses

**Tip:** Your website content will be adapted to suit WhatsApp's conversational style automatically.

## Differences from Textual Chatbot

While this step is similar to the textual chatbot's "Connect Site" step, there are key differences:

| Aspect | Textual Chatbot | WhatsApp Chatbot |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Platform** | Website widget | WhatsApp messaging |
| **Response Style** | Can be longer, more detailed | Shorter, more conversational |
| **User Context** | Browsing your website | May not be on your website |
| **Media Support** | Limited to widget | Can send images, documents, voice |

## What Content Works Best?

### Highly Effective Content:
- ✅ FAQ pages
- ✅ Product/service descriptions
- ✅ Pricing information
- ✅ Contact and location details
- ✅ How-to guides and tutorials
- ✅ Company policies (returns, shipping, etc.)

### Less Effective Content:
- ❌ Blog posts (unless highly relevant)
- ❌ News articles (unless current)
- ❌ Legal jargon (unless simplified)
- ❌ Highly technical documentation (unless your audience is technical)
