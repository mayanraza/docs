## Customize Your Welcome Message

### Welcome Message Text
**Purpose:** The first message users receive when they message your WhatsApp number.

- Create an engaging, friendly greeting
- Example: "Hey 👋 I'm here for you! I'm ChatGPT, and I can answer your questions about TechBackers and our services."
- Keep it conversational - WhatsApp is an informal platform
- Use emojis to add personality and warmth
- Clearly state what the chatbot can help with

**WhatsApp Best Practices:**
- Keep it under 2-3 sentences
- Be warm and welcoming
- Set clear expectations about what the bot can do
- Use a friendly, conversational tone

---

## Buttons

**Purpose:** Quick reply buttons that appear with the welcome message for instant navigation.

Add buttons for common user needs:

- **FAQ** - Frequently asked questions
- **About Us** - Company information
- **Contact Us** - How to reach you

**How to Configure:**
1. Click the **+** button to add more buttons
2. Each button triggers a specific response or flow
3. Limit to 3 buttons for WhatsApp (platform limitation)

**WhatsApp Button Guidelines:**
- Maximum 3 buttons per message
- Button text should be short (max 20 characters)
- Use action-oriented language ("Get Pricing", not "Pricing Information")

---

## Company Information

### Company Name
**Purpose:** Your business name as it appears in conversations.

- Enter your official business name
- Example: "TechBackers"
- This helps users confirm they're chatting with the right business
- Should match your WhatsApp Business Profile name

### Company Industry
**Purpose:** Your business sector for context-aware responses.

- Select from dropdown (e.g., "Healthcare & Life Sciences")
- Helps the AI understand industry-specific terminology
- Influences response style and recommendations
- Ensures appropriate tone for your sector

---

## Contact Information

### Contact Number
**Purpose:** Primary phone number for your business.

- Include country code (e.g., +92)
- Format: +92 - +1 444-567-6578
- This can be shared with users who need direct contact
- Should be a number that's actively monitored

### Contact Email
**Purpose:** Primary email for customer support.

- Use a monitored support email
- Example: support@techbackers.com
- The chatbot can share this for complex inquiries
- Useful for sending documents or detailed information

---

## Social Media Profiles

**Purpose:** Link other communication channels for multi-platform engagement.

- Click **Add Social Media** to include:
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Twitter/X
  - LinkedIn
  - YouTube
- Provides users alternative ways to connect
- Builds brand presence across platforms

---

## Goodbye Message

**Purpose:** Friendly closing message when conversations end.

- Example: "If you need anything else, you can send a message anytime. I'm here to help!"
- Encourages users to return
- Reinforces 24/7 availability
- Leaves a positive impression

**WhatsApp Considerations:**
- WhatsApp conversations don't really "end" like website chats
- This message may appear after periods of inactivity
- Keep it short and welcoming for future messages

---

## Live Preview

The right panel shows a **WhatsApp-style preview** of your greeting:

- **TechBackers** header with company name
- Welcome message in a WhatsApp bubble
- Quick reply buttons below the message
- Authentic WhatsApp interface look and feel

**What to Check:**
- Message length (should fit in 2-3 bubbles max)
- Button text clarity
- Overall visual appeal
- Emoji rendering

---

## WhatsApp-Specific Best Practices

### Message Formatting

WhatsApp supports rich text formatting:

```
*Bold text* - Use asterisks
_Italic text_ - Use underscores
~Strikethrough~ - Use tildes
```monospace``` - Use three backticks
```

**Example Welcome Message:**
```
Hey 👋 I'm here for you!

I'm *TechBackers AI Assistant*, and I can help you with:
• Web Development services
• Pricing information
• Project inquiries
• General questions

Just type your question or tap a button below!

### Tone Guidelines

| Industry | Recommended Tone | Example Opening |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

> [!WARNING]
> **Avoid These Common Errors:**

❌ **Too Long:** WhatsApp users expect quick, scannable messages
- **Instead:** Keep welcome message under 100 words

❌ **Too Formal:** WhatsApp is a casual platform
- **Instead:** Use conversational language and emojis

❌ **Unclear Purpose:** Users don't know what the bot can do
- **Instead:** Clearly list what the bot can help with

❌ **Too Many Buttons:** More than 3 buttons overwhelms users
- **Instead:** Stick to 3 most important options

❌ **Generic Message:** Doesn't reflect your brand
- **Instead:** Customize with your brand voice and personality
