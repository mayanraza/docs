# Analytics & Insights

Botifire's analytics engine provides data-driven insights into your AI's performance, user engagement, and operational efficiency.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The primary dashboard provides a high-level summary of your automation success.

### Message Volume
Track the total flow of information through your bots:
- **Total Messages**: The sum of all incoming and outgoing messages.
- **Bot Responses**: Number of messages successfully delivered by the AI.
- **User Messages**: Total queries initiated by your customers.
- **Failed Messages**: Technical disruptions or undelivered messages that may require attention.

### Average Response Speed
This metric measures the time elapsed between a user query and the AI's response.
- **Optimization**: Standard responses are usually delivered in **seconds**.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Our system calculates this in milliseconds to ensure ultra-low latency.

## Best Practices for Optimization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Monitor Token Spikes**: Unusual spikes in token usage might indicate a query loop or highly ambiguous Knowledge Base data.

1. **Review Response Speed**: If the average speed drops, consider simplifying your KB or reducing the number of complex [WhatsApp Flows](/features/whatsapp-flows).
2. **Geographical Targeting**: Use the country summary to decide which languages to prioritize for [Voice AI Agents](/features/voice-ai).
