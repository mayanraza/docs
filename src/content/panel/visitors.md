## Best Practices for Monitoring

> [!NOTE]
> **Check "Unanswered" Queries**: Regularly review conversation histories to find queries the AI couldn't answer. Use these to update your [Knowledge Base](/panel/training).

1. **Observe Lead Quality**: Use the visitors' geolocation to verify your target audience engagement.
2. **Track Bot Efficiency**: See how many visitors reach the "Checkout" or "Lead Captured" state without human intervention.
